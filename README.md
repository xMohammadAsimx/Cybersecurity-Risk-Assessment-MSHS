Academic project demonstrating a FAIR-based cybersecurity risk assessment for a simulated healthcare organization.

# Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Project (FAIR Model)

This repository contains my university project on cybersecurity risk assessment using the **FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk)** framework.  
It demonstrates the process of identifying, analyzing, and mitigating cyber risks for a **simulated healthcare organization (MSHS)**.

---

## Project Overview

This project was completed as part of my **University Cybersecurity Risk Management course**.  
It applies the FAIR methodology and complementary frameworks like **NIST CSF** and **MITRE ATT&CK** to assess risks in a simulated healthcare environment.

**Objective:**  
To quantify cybersecurity risks affecting electronic health record (EHR) systems and propose data-driven mitigation strategies.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Identifying critical assets and threat actors  
- Mapping vulnerabilities to MITRE ATT&CK techniques  
- Calculating risk probabilities and potential loss magnitude  
- Recommending prioritized mitigation actions

---

## Methodology

| Framework | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| FAIR | Quantitative risk analysis |
| NIST CSF | Governance and control alignment |
| MITRE ATT&CK | Threat behavior mapping |

The analysis evaluates potential risks such as:
- Insider threats  
- Ransomware attacks  
- Data breaches  
- Credential compromise  
- System downtime  

---

## Results Summary

- **Highest risk area:** Insider credential misuse  
- **Moderate risk areas:** Ransomware, phishing campaigns  
- **Recommended controls:** MFA enforcement, network segmentation, employee training  
- **Expected outcome:** Reduced risk exposure by ~45% in modeled scenarios
